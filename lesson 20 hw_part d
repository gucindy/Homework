%Julia has $300 in her bank account earning 1.25% interest while Max has only $280 but he earns 2% interest. How many years before Max has more money in his account than Julia?
const J := 0.0125
const M := 0.02
var year : int:=0
var julia: real:=0
var Max: real:=0
loop
    year += 1
    julia+=300 * J * year+300
    Max += 280* M * year+280
    exit when Max>julia
end loop
put year, " years before Max has more money than Julia."
